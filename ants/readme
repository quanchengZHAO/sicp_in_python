Ants type:
Harvester: Add food
Thrower: Throw a leaf to the nearest bee in front
Fire: When dead, reduce the armor of all Bees in the same Place
Short: Throw at a Bee that is found after following at most 2 entrance transitions
Long: Throw at a Bee that is found after following at least 4 entrance transitions
Wall: Add some protection (no damage)
Ninja: Damages all Bees that pass by, but is never seen.
Scuba: Anti-water thrower
Hungry: Eat a random Bee from its place and digest 3 turns
Bodyguard: It can occupy the same Place as another ant.
           It shields the other ant and protects it from damage.
           Attacks should damage the BodyguardAnt first and only hurt the protected ant after the BodyguardAnt has perished.
Slow: Applies a slow effect for 3 turns.
Stun: Applies a stun effect for 1 turn.
Queen: waterproof
       Whenever the queen throws a leaf, she also doubles the damage of all other ants in the same tunnel with her,
       including any ants protected by a bodyguard. Once any ant's damage has doubled, it cannot be doubled again.
       If a bee ever enters the place occupied by the queen, then the bees immediately win the game.
       The game ends even if the queen is protected by a bodyguard.
